# Senior Angular Developer Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. Explain the concept of **Change Detection Strategy** in Angular.  
**When would you use `OnPush`, and what are the common pitfalls to avoid when implementing it?**

### ✅ Answer:

**Change Detection Strategy** in Angular dictates *when* and *how* Angular checks for changes in the application state to update the DOM.  
There are two primary strategies:

- **Default (`CheckAlways`)**  
  Angular checks **every component** in the component tree from top to bottom whenever any asynchronous event occurs (e.g., user input, HTTP responses, `setTimeout`, Promises).  
  🔁 It's thorough but **can be inefficient** in large apps.

- **`OnPush`**  
  Angular only checks a component and its subtree when:

  1. One of its `@Input()` properties changes **by reference** (i.e., a new object or array is assigned, not mutated).
  2. An **event is emitted** from the component (e.g., a click).
  3. An **observable** (with the `async` pipe) emits a new value in the template.
  4. You manually trigger detection via `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` or `markForCheck()`.

### 🛠️ When to Use `OnPush`

Use `OnPush` for **performance optimization**, especially for:

- Feature components with `@Input()` data.
- Large/complex UIs.
- Encouraging **immutability** and cleaner state management.

It minimizes unnecessary checks, improves performance, and makes debugging more predictable.

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

#### 1. **Mutating Input Objects/Arrays**

> Example of what **not** to do:
```ts
this.items.push(newItem);  // Mutation – won't trigger change detection
this.data.name = 'Updated';  // Mutation – reference is the same
```

✅ **Solution**:
Use new references:

```ts
this.items = [...this.items, newItem];  // New array reference
this.data = { ...this.data, name: 'Updated' };  // New object
```

---

#### 2. **External Side Effects (e.g., from Services)**

If a service updates data used by a component with `OnPush` and **doesn't trigger change detection**, the component won't update.

✅ **Solution**:

- Use the `async` pipe with `Observables` to auto-trigger updates.
- Or call `markForCheck()` after external changes.

---

#### 3. **Mixing Default and OnPush Unintentionally**

Mixing strategies can lead to **unexpected behavior**.  
An `OnPush` parent won’t update children unless its own inputs change.

✅ **Solution**: Understand and document component boundaries and change detection flows.

---

#### 4. **Harder Debugging**

With `OnPush`, it’s common to wonder *“Why isn’t this updating?”*. It’s usually due to:

- Input mutation
- No new observable emission
- No manual change detection

✅ **Tip**: Use **Angular DevTools** to track change detection runs.

> 🔍 Summary:  
`OnPush` is a powerful strategy for Angular performance, but it requires discipline in managing data immutably and understanding the detection flow.
