# Mastering Transaction Isolation Levels and Row-Level Locking in .NET

Database concurrency is one of the most critical aspects of building robust applications. **Transaction isolation levels** define how much one transaction is protected from the effects of other concurrent transactions. Choosing the right level helps balance **data consistency** and **system performance**.

---

## üîë Transaction Isolation Levels

The isolation level determines how concurrent transactions interact with each other. The three main anomalies it addresses are:

- **Dirty Reads** ‚Äì Reading uncommitted changes made by another transaction.
- **Non-Repeatable Reads** ‚Äì Reading the same row twice in a transaction and getting different results because another transaction updated it.
- **Phantom Reads** ‚Äì Running the same query twice but getting additional rows the second time, due to another transaction inserting new data.

Common isolation levels:

1. **Read Uncommitted** ‚Äì Allows dirty reads. Fastest but least safe.
2. **Read Committed** (default in SQL Server) ‚Äì Prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.
3. **Repeatable Read** ‚Äì Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads, but phantom reads can still occur.
4. **Serializable** ‚Äì Highest level, prevents all three anomalies. Strong consistency but can severely limit concurrency.
5. **Snapshot** ‚Äì Provides a transactionally consistent snapshot of the data, avoiding many locks but with overhead on tempdb.

## ‚öôÔ∏è When to Use Explicit Transactions with Row-Level Lock

Explicit transactions give you control over **when a transaction begins and ends**, allowing finer handling of data integrity.  
Use them when:

- You need to ensure multiple operations succeed or fail together (e.g., transferring money between accounts).
- You require **row-level consistency** when updating multiple related tables.
- You must control **lock granularity** to avoid broader table locks.

**Row-level locks** are useful when:

- Multiple transactions update **different rows in the same table** at the same time.
- You want to **minimize contention** while still ensuring correctness.
- For high-concurrency systems (e.g., order processing, inventory management).

In SQL Server, row-level locks are acquired automatically when updating individual rows. You can enforce explicit behavior using **lock hints** like `WITH (ROWLOCK)`.

Example in SQL:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Orders WITH (ROWLOCK)
SET Status = 'Processed'
WHERE OrderId = 123;
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

## üîÑ When to Change the Isolation Level

Change the isolation level when:

- **Performance issues** arise due to excessive locking (consider lowering isolation).
- **Data consistency** is critical (raise the isolation level).
- You want to avoid blocking by using **Snapshot Isolation** or `READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT`.

In .NET, you can set it like this:

```csharp
using (var transaction = connection.BeginTransaction(System.Data.IsolationLevel.RepeatableRead))
{
    // Execute your commands within this transaction
    // Isolation level ensures consistency
    transaction.Commit();
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deadlocks and Race Conditions

- **Deadlock** ‚Äì Occurs when two transactions hold locks and wait for each other to release them. SQL Server detects and kills one transaction (the "victim").
- **Race Condition** ‚Äì Happens when multiple processes attempt to update the same resource simultaneously, leading to inconsistent results.

**Best Practices**:
- Always access resources in a **consistent order** to avoid deadlocks.
- Keep transactions **short** to reduce lock contention.
- Use **row-level locks** instead of broader locks where possible.
- Retry failed transactions after a deadlock (SQL Server throws error 1205).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Row-Level Locking in .NET

In .NET (with Entity Framework or ADO.NET), you can enforce row-level locks:

**Entity Framework Example:**

```csharp
using var transaction = dbContext.Database.BeginTransaction(System.Data.IsolationLevel.Serializable);

var order = dbContext.Orders
    .FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Orders WITH (ROWLOCK, UPDLOCK) WHERE OrderId = {0}", orderId)
    .First();

order.Status = "Processed";
dbContext.SaveChanges();

transaction.Commit();
```

**Key Points:**
- `ROWLOCK` enforces row-level granularity.
- `UPDLOCK` ensures other transactions can‚Äôt read the row until the update completes.
- Using explicit transactions ensures atomicity and avoids race conditions.

---

## üìå Summary

- **Isolation levels** balance consistency and performance.
- Use **explicit transactions** and **row-level locks** for high-concurrency scenarios requiring data integrity.
- Change isolation levels strategically depending on performance vs. consistency needs.
- Handle **deadlocks** by keeping transactions short, ordering resources consistently, and retrying failed operations.
- In .NET, use **ADO.NET or Entity Framework** with explicit transactions and lock hints for precise concurrency control.
